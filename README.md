# Popcorn-Trivia

This app uses HTML, Bootstrap, Moment.js, and vanilla JS.

This is a timed popcorn trivia quiz with ten questions. The player has 25 seconds to answer all the questions; if he does not answer in the alotted time, all unanswered questions will return as incorrect. The player is told how many questions he has answered correctly when the time runs out.

Needed fixes include removing the alert function and replacing it perhaps with React.js. This would also easily allow added code to let the player to see which answer is correct of to the side of the question. A button to restart the quiz (maybe linked with the original 'Start') would be helpful as well.
